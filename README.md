### Background
**Prologue**
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

***Introduction***
This project uses data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. They were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: "exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front" (Class E)(Velloso, Bulling, Gellersen, Ugulino, & Fuks, 2013).

1. The goal of our project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.
2. The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome variable. 
3. There are variables to predict the "classe" with.
4. 

***Data ***

1. The training data for this project were available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
2. The test data were available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv
3. The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If we use the document we create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. 
4. It will also describe how we built your model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices we did.
5. This research also uses prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 

All in all, this report consists of a link to a Github repo with R markdown and compiled HTML file describing this analysis. The total writeup is < 2000 words and there are less than 5 figures.
